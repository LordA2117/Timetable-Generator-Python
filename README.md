# Final-Code
School Project

This ain't perfect and my current skill (in 2025 compared to 2022 or '23) FAR exceeds this, but I thought I'd make it public because this IS still a really good concept I was asked to implement (though my skill issues hold this back ðŸ˜”). I am told my old school still uses this slow piece of noob code ðŸ˜‚.

Maybe I will get back to it one day lol.
